You need Python and libcurl installed on your system to use pycurl.

To build pycurl for Python 1.5.2 you also need the distutils package,
which you can download from:
	
	http://www.python.org/sigs/distutils-sig/download.html

Assuming that distutils is installed (which it is by default on Python
versions above 1.5.2) build and install pycurl with the following
commands:

	(become root)
	tar -zxvf pycurl-0.1.tar.gz
	cd pycurl-0.1
	python setup.py install

You can also install by hand which does not require distutils.  Edit
the 'src/Makefile' in the distribution directory to suit your setup.
Type 'make' and copy the file 'src/curlmodule.so' to the site-package
directory of your Python installation (for example
/usr/lib/python2.0/site-packages).

NOTE: I have not tried to build pycurl on Windows, but I assume this
can be done with minimal efforts using the distutils approach.
