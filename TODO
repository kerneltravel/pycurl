If you want to hack on pycurl, here's our list of unresolved issues:

    * Support curl_multi_info_read
    * Documentation
    * A high-level interface to pycurl, like the standard urllib (see
      the file 'doc/examples/curl.py' for a simple example)
    * Once libcurl 7.9.9 is out, add SIGPIPE and NOSIGNAL to the tests.
