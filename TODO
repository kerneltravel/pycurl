If you want to hack on pycurl, here's our list of unresolved issues:

    * A high-level interface to pycurl, like the standard urllib (see
      the file 'doc/examples/curl.py' for a simple example)
    * Add error handling when an individual curl handle fails on the
      multi stack (need a way to extract errors from curl objects
      after the info_read method has been called)
