If you want to hack on pycurl, here's our list of unresolved issues:

    * The current curl HLI only works on Python 2.2 or better. Either
      fix this, or change the docs and setup.py accordingly.

    * Add more options to Curl.unsetopt(). Have to carefully check
      the libcurl source code for each option we want to support.

    * Are we possibly leaking references with CURLOPT_PROGRESSDATA
      and CURLOPT_PASSWDDATA ??
