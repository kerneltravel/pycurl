If you want to hack on pycurl, here's our list of unresolved issues:


NEW FEATURES/IMPROVEMENTS:

    * Callback handling for stream seek.

    * Add docs to the high-level interface.


DEFICIENICES:

    * Using certain invalid options, it may be possible to cause a crash.
      This is un-Pythonic behaviour, but you somewhere have to draw a
      line between efficiency (and feature completeness) and safety.
      There _are_ quite a number of internal error checks, but tracking
      and catching all possible (deliberate) misuses is not a goal
      (and probably impossible anyway, due to the complexity of libcurl).
