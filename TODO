If you want to hack on pycurl, here's our list of unresolved issues:

    * Documentation (this is actually starting to get critical)
    * Once set, callbacks cannot be subsequently disabled for a given handle
    * The multi interface is not supported, should make something that
      peacefully co-exists with the select module
